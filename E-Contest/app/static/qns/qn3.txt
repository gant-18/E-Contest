                                                     COUNT

Take a string containing only ‘a’ and ‘b’ as input and output the number of b’s present in the string.
The string can be of any length less than 100 but it is guaranteed that the number of b’s in the string is
less than 10.

INPUT   :  Single string containing only ‘a’ and ‘b’. (length of string <100)
OUTPUT  :  Single integer denoting the number of b's.

EXAMPLES:

INPUT   :  abbbaaabababaa
OUTPUT  :  6

INPUT   :  bababababbba
OUTPUT  :  7
